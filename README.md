# Mitchell's Powershell setup script

Why do repetetive tasks when the computer can do them for you?

This simple Powershell script installs [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and uses choco commands to install my frequently used programs.

This allows me to be up and running quickly on a fresh Windows install.  
Last tested on Windows 10 version 1909.

### Running the script

1) Open Powershell as an administrator.
2) Run the command `set-executionpolicy unrestricted` to enable execution of the script.
3) Let chocolatey do its thing
