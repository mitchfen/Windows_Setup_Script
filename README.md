# Mitchell's Powershell setup script

Why do repetetive tasks when the computer can do them for you?

This simple Powershell script installs [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and then uses choco commands to install my frequently used programs.

Use the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` to enable execution of the script.

This allows me to be up and running on a fresh Windows install much faster than I would otherwise.

### TODO:

* Format the output better, clean it up so it's easier to track install progress
* Cleanup start menu
* Disable telemetry
* Disable Cortana
